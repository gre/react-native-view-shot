Capture a React Native view to an image.

<img src="./example/docs/recursive.gif" width=300 />

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-native-view-shot
react-native link react-native-view-shot
```

Make sure react-native-view-shot is correctly linked in XCode (might require a manual installation, refer to [React Native doc](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html)).

## Recommended High Level API

```js
import ViewShot from "react-native-view-shot";

class ExampleCaptureOnMountManually extends Component {
  componentDidMount () {
    this.refs.viewShot.capture().then(uri => {
      console.log("do something with ", uri);
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ViewShot ref="viewShot" options={{ format: "jpg", quality: 0.9 }}>
        <Text>...Something to rasterize...</Text>
      </ViewShot>
    );
  }
}

// alternative
class ExampleCaptureOnMountSimpler extends Component {
  onCapture = uri => {
    console.log("do something with ", uri);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ViewShot onCapture={this.onCapture} captureMode="mount">
        <Text>...Something to rasterize...</Text>
      </ViewShot>
    );
  }
}

// waiting an image
class ExampleWaitingCapture extends Component {
  onImageLoad = () => {
    this.refs.viewShot.capture().then(uri => {
      console.log("do something with ", uri);
    })
  };
  render() {
    return (
      <ViewShot ref="viewShot">
        <Text>...Something to rasterize...</Text>
        <Image ... onLoad={this.onImageLoad} />
      </ViewShot>
    );
  }
}

// capture ScrollView content
class ExampleCaptureScrollViewContent extends Component {
  onCapture = uri => {
    console.log("do something with ", uri);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ScrollView>
        <ViewShot onCapture={this.onCapture} captureMode="mount">
          <Text>...The Scroll View Content Goes Here...</Text>
        </ViewShot>
      </ScrollView>
    );
  }
}
```
**Props:**

- **`children`**: the actual content to rasterize.
- **`options`**: the same options as in `captureRef` method.
- **`captureMode`** (string):
  - if not defined (default). the capture is not automatic and you need to use the ref and call `capture()` yourself.
  - `"mount"`. Capture the view once at mount. (It is important to understand image loading won't be waited, in such case you want to use `"none"` with `viewShotRef.capture()` after `Image#onLoad`.)
  - `"continuous"` EXPERIMENTAL, this will capture A LOT of images continuously. For very specific use-cases.
  - `"update"` EXPERIMENTAL, this will capture images each time React redraw (on did update). For very specific use-cases.
- **`onCapture`**: when a `captureMode` is defined, this callback will be called with the capture result.
- **`onCaptureFailure`**: when a `captureMode` is defined, this callback will be called when a capture fails.

## `captureRef(view, options)` lower level imperative API

```js
import { captureRef } from "react-native-view-shot";

captureRef(viewRef, {
  format: "jpg",
  quality: 0.8
})
.then(
  uri => console.log("Image saved to", uri),
  error => console.error("Oops, snapshot failed", error)
);
```

Returns a Promise of the image URI.

- **`view`** is a reference to a React Native component.
- **`options`** may include:
  - **`width`** / **`height`** *(number)*: the width and height of the final image (resized from the View bound. don't provide it if you want the original pixel size).
  - **`format`** *(string)*: either `png` or `jpg` or `webm` (Android). Defaults to `png`.
  - **`quality`** *(number)*: the quality. 0.0 - 1.0 (default). (only available on lossy formats like jpg)
  - **`result`** *(string)*, the method you want to use to save the snapshot, one of:
    - `"tmpfile"` (default): save to a temporary file *(that will only exist for as long as the app is running)*.
    - `"base64"`: encode as base64 and returns the raw string. Use only with small images as this may result of lags (the string is sent over the bridge). *N.B. This is not a data uri, use `data-uri` instead*.
    - `"data-uri"`: same as `base64` but also includes the [Data URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme) header.
  - **`scaleRealPixelSize`** *(bool)*: if true the captured image size will be scaled so that the real pixel size will match the input width/height.
  - **`snapshotContentContainer`** *(bool)*: if true and when view is a ScrollView, the "content container" height will be evaluated instead of the container height.

## `releaseCapture(uri)`

This method release a previously captured `uri`. For tmpfile it will clean them out, for other result types it just won't do anything.

NB: the tmpfile captures are automatically cleaned out after the app closes, so you might not have to worry about this unless advanced usecases. The `ViewShot` component will use it each time you capture more than once (useful for continuous capture to not leak files).

## `captureScreen()` Android and iOS Only

```js
import { captureScreen } from "react-native-view-shot";

captureScreen({
  format: "jpg",
  quality: 0.8
})
.then(
  uri => console.log("Image saved to", uri),
  error => console.error("Oops, snapshot failed", error)
);
```

This method will capture the contents of the currently displayed screen as a native hardware screenshot. It does not require a ref input, as it does not work at the view level. This means that ScrollViews will not be captured in their entirety - only the portions currently visible to the user. 

Returns a Promise of the image URI.

- **`options`**: the same options as in `captureRef` method.

## Interoperability Table

> Snapshots are not guaranteed to be pixel perfect. It also depends on the platform. Here is some difference we have noticed and how to workaround.

Model tested: iPhone 6 (iOS), Nexus 5 (Android).

| System             | iOS                | Android           | Windows           |

1. Only supported by wrapping a `<View collapsable={false}>` parent and snapshotting it.
2. It returns an empty image (not a failure Promise).
3. Component itself lacks platform support.
4. But you can just use the react-native-maps snapshot function: https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps#take-snapshot-of-map

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### Saving to a file?

- If you want to save the snapshotted image result to the CameraRoll, just use https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/cameraroll.html#savetocameraroll
- If you want to save it to an arbitrary file path, use something like https://github.com/itinance/react-native-fs
- For any more advanced needs, you can write your own (or find another) native module that would solve your use-case.

### The snapshot is rejected with an error?

- Support of special components like Video / GL views is not guaranteed to work. In case of failure, the `captureRef` promise gets rejected (the library won't crash).

### get a black or blank result or still have an error with simple views?

Check the **Interoperability Table** above. Some special components are unfortunately not supported. If you have a View that contains one of an unsupported component, the whole snapshot might be compromised as well.

### black background instead of transparency / weird border appear around texts?

- It's preferable to **use a background color on the view you rasterize** to avoid transparent pixels and potential weirdness that some border appear around texts.

### on Android, getting "Trying to resolve view with tag '{tagID}' which doesn't exist"

> you need to make sure `collapsable` is set to `false` if you want to snapshot a **View**. Some content might even need to be wrapped into such `<View collapsable={false}>` to actually make them snapshotable! Otherwise that view won't reflect any UI View. ([found by @gaguirre](https://github.com/gre/react-native-view-shot/issues/7#issuecomment-245302844))

Alternatively, you can use the `ViewShot` component that will have `collapsable={false}` set to solve this problem.

### Getting "The content size must not be zero or negative."

> Make sure you don't snapshot instantly, you need to wait at least there is a first `onLayout` event, or after a timeout, otherwise the View might not be ready yet. (It should also be safe to just wait Image `onLoad` if you have one). If you still have the problem, make sure your view actually have a width and height > 0.

Alternatively, you can use the `ViewShot` component that will wait the first `onLayout`.

### Snapshotted image does not match my width and height but is twice/3-times bigger

This is because the snapshot image result is in real pixel size where the width/height defined in a React Native style are defined in "point" unit. You might want to set width and height option to force a resize (might affect image quality). Use the `options` property `scaleRealPixelSize` to resize the image result to the input `width`/`height` properties.
